# Role-Based Dashboard System

## Overview

KaryaSetu now features **two separate dashboards** based on user roles:

1. **Customer Dashboard** - For users who book services
2. **Worker Dashboard** - For service providers

The system automatically detects the user's role and redirects them to the appropriate dashboard.

```

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Authentication & Routing**

When a user logs in and completes onboarding:
- Their role (`customer` or `worker`) is stored in `localStorage` as `karyasetu_user_role`
- When accessing `/dashboard/dashboard.html`, the router checks their role
- User is automatically redirected to the appropriate dashboard

### 2. **Customer Dashboard Features**

**Navigation:**
- Browse Services (Mechanic, Plumber, Electrician, etc.)
- My Bookings
- Favorites
- Nearby Workers
- Wallet
- Profile
- Support & Settings

**Dashboard Widgets:**
- Active Bookings counter

- Wallet balance
- Favorite workers count
- Quick service access
- Recent activity feed
- Nearby workers list
- Trending services

**Key Pages:**
- Service browsing with worker listings
- Worker profiles with ratings
- Booking management
- Favorites list
- Location-based worker search

### 3. **Worker Dashboard Features**

- Job History
- Availability toggle
- Earnings tracking
- Wallet

**Key Pages:**

### 4. **Availability Toggle (Worker Only)**

Workers have a special status indicator in the topbar:
- **Green dot** = Available for jobs
- **Gray dot** = Offline
- Toggle button to switch between states
- Status is prominently displayed

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Role Detection

```javascript
const userRole = localStorage.getItem('karyasetu_user_role');

if (userRole === 'customer') {
  window.location.href = 'customer-dashboard.html';
} else if (userRole === 'worker') {
  window.location.href = 'worker-dashboard.html';
}
```

### Role Verification

Each dashboard JavaScript file verifies the user has the correct role:

```javascript
// In customer-dashboard.js
if (userRole !== 'customer') {
  window.location.href = '../dashboard/worker-dashboard.html';
}

// In worker-dashboard.js
if (userRole !== 'worker') {
  window.location.href = '../dashboard/customer-dashboard.html';
}
```

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding New Pages

**For Customer Dashboard:**
```javascript
// In customer-dashboard.js, add to getPageContent()
'new-page': getNewPage(),

function getNewPage() {
  return `
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 class="page-title">New Page</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="page-content">
      <!-- Your content -->
    </div>
  `;
}
```

**For Worker Dashboard:**
```javascript
// In worker-dashboard.js, add to getPageContent()
'new-page': getNewPage(),

function getNewPage() {
  return `
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 class="page-title">New Page</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="page-content">
      <!-- Your content -->
    </div>
  `;
}
```

### Adding Navigation Links

**Customer Dashboard:**
```html
<!-- In customer-dashboard.html -->
<a href="#" class="nav-link" data-page="new-page">
  <span class="nav-icon">🆕</span>
  <span class="nav-text">New Page</span>
</a>
```

**Worker Dashboard:**
```html
<!-- In worker-dashboard.html -->
<a href="#" class="nav-link" data-page="new-page">
  <span class="nav-icon">🆕</span>
  <span class="nav-text">New Page</span>
</a>
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### User stuck on loading screen
- Check if `karyasetu_user_role` is set in localStorage
- Verify user completed onboarding
- Check browser console for errors

### Wrong dashboard loads
- Clear localStorage and re-login
- Verify role selection during onboarding
- Check role-select.html is setting the role correctly

### Styles not loading
